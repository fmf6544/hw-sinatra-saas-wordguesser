Part 0: Demystifying SaaS app creation
==============================

**Goal:** Understand the steps needed to create, version, and deploy a SaaS app, including tracking the libraries it 
depends on so that your production and development environments are as similar as possible.

**What you will do:** Create a simple "hello world" app using the Sinatra framework, version it properly, and deploy 
it to Heroku.

## Creating and versioning a simple SaaS app

SaaS apps are developed on your computer but *deployed to production* on a server that others can access.  We try to 
minimize the differences between the development and production *environments*, to avoid difficult-to-diagnose problems 
in which something works one way on your development computer but a different way (or not at all) when that code is 
deployed to production.

We have two mechanisms for keeping the development and production environments consistent.  The first is *version 
control*, such as `git`, for the app's code. But since almost all apps also rely on *libraries* written by 
others, such as *gems* in the case of Ruby, we need a way to keep track of which versions of which libraries our 
app has been tested with, so that the same ones are used in development and production.

Happily, Ruby has a wonderful system for managing gem dependencies: a gem called **bundler** looks for a file called 
`Gemfile` in the *app root directory* of each project. The `Gemfile` contains a list of gems and versions your app 
depends on. Bundler verifies that those gems, and any others that they in turn depend on, are properly installed on 
your system and accessible to the app.

## Let's start with the following steps:

* Create a new empty directory to hold your new app, and use `git init` in that directory to start versioning it with 
Git.

* In that directory, create a new file called `Gemfile` (the capitalization is important) with the following contents. 
This file will be a permanent part of your app and will travel with your app anywhere it goes:

```rb
source 'https://rubygems.org'
ruby  '3.3.8'

gem 'sinatra', '~> 4.0'
gem 'rackup'
gem 'webrick'
```

The first line says that the preferred place to download any necessary gems is https://rubygems.org, which is where the
Ruby community registers "production-ready" gems.

The second line specifies which version of the Ruby language interpreter is required.  If we omitted this line, Bundler 
wouldn't try to verify which version of Ruby is available; there are subtle differences between the versions, and not 
all gems work with all versions, so it's best to specify this.

The third line says we need version 4.0 or later of the `sinatra` gem. In some cases, we don't need to specify which 
version of a gem we want; in this case, we do specify it because we rely on some features that are absent from earlier 
versions of Sinatra.

The fourth and fifth lines specify that we want to also include the [`rackup`](https://github.com/rack/rack) and 
[`webrick`](https://github.com/ruby/webrick) gems.  These applications will help us deploy our application and provide
us a web server to communicate with.

* Also in that directory, create a new file called `Dockerfile` (the capitalization here is also important) with the following
contents. This will provide directions on how the Docker container will be constructed.
```dockerfile
FROM ruby:3.3.8

RUN gem install bundler

WORKDIR /app

# Default to the interactive bash shell
CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```

* Build the Docker image with the following command:
```bash
docker build -t myapp .
```

* Once it's built, we can run the Docker container as shown below. Note that once you execute this command, you 
should be presented with a bash shell prompt that is executing inside the running container. That is, it's a shell in 
the container, not on your host operating system.
```bash
  docker run -p 3000:3000 -v "$(pwd)":/app -it myapp
```

## Run Bundler

Now that we have a running Docker container (with the software necessary to build and run our application), we will do
just that.

Using the Docker container's shell, run the command `bundle install`, which examines your `Gemfile` to make sure the 
correct gems (and, where specified, the correct versions) are available, and tries to install them otherwise. 
This will create a new file `Gemfile.lock`

Open a new shell on your host computer (that is, outside the Docker container) and navigate to the same directory 
where this project's code is based. Look at that directory's contents. You will see the `Dockerfile` and the `Gemfile`,
and also the newly created `Gemfile.lock` file. If you return to the shell from the Docker container, you will see the 
same files. When we ran the container, we specified that rather than copying the files of our project, we would
__mount__ them into the container. Thus, you can see them both inside and outside of the container.

Let's put these files under version control. We will issue the following `git` commands, but note that this needs to be 
done in the shell that is running on the host computer, not the shell from the Docker container. Why? The running 
container does not have the necessary `git` software installed, so issuing these commands in the container will not be
successful. (Hint: keep your shells straight, it can be easy to confuse them!)

To place under version control, use these commands:

```sh
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Set up the Gemfile"
```

The first command stages all changed files for committing. The second command commits the staged files with the 
comment in the quotes. You can repeat these commands to commit future changes. Remember that these are LOCAL commits 
-- if you want these changes on GitHub, you'll need to do a `git push` command, which we will show later.

  <p><blockquote><code>Gemfile</code> specifies the gems you need and in some cases the constraints on which version(s) are acceptable. <code>Gemfile.lock</code> records the *actual* versions found, not only of the gems you specified explicitly but also any other gems on which they depend, so it is the file used by the production environment to reproduce the gems available in the development environment.</blockquote></p>

  <summary>After running <code>bundle</code>, why are there gems listed in <code>Gemfile.lock</code>

  <p><blockquote>Bundler looked up the information for each Gem you requested (in this case, <code>sinatra</code>, <code>rackup</code>, and <code>webrick</code>) and realized that it depends on other gems, which in turn depend on still others, so it recursively installed all those dependencies.  For example, the <code>rack</code> appserver is a gem, and while you didn't explicitly request it, <code>sinatra</code> depends on it.  This is an example of the power of automation: rather than requiring you (the app developer) to understand every Gem dependency, Bundler automates that process and lets you focus only on your app's top-level dependencies.</blockquote></p>
</details>

Create a simple SaaS app with Sinatra
-------------------------------------

As Chapter 2 of ESaaS explains, SaaS apps require a web server to receive HTTP requests from the outside world, and 
an application server that "connects" your app's logic to the web server. For development, we will use `webrick`, a 
very simple Ruby-based web server that would be inappropriate for production but is fine for development. In both 
development and production, we will use the `rack` Ruby-based application server, which supports Ruby apps written in 
various frameworks, including Sinatra and Rails.

As Chapter 2 of *ESaaS* explains, a SaaS app essentially recognizes and responds to HTTP requests corresponding to 
the application's *routes* (recall that a route consists of an HTTP method such as `GET` or `POST` plus a URI). 
Sinatra provides an extremely lightweight shorthand for matching a route with the app code to be executed when a 
request using that route arrives from the Web server.

Create a file in your project called `app.rb` containing the following. Remember that you can not easily create and edit
files in the container due to the minimal software installed in the container. So create this file on your host computer
(outside the running Docker container).

```rb
require 'sinatra'

class MyApp < Sinatra::Base
  get '/' do
    "<!DOCTYPE html><html><head></head><body><h1>Hello World</h1></body></html>"
  end
end
```

The `get` method is provided by the `Sinatra::Base` class, from which our `MyApp` class inherits; `Sinatra::Base` 
is available because we load the Sinatra library on line 1.

#### Self Check Question

<details>
  <summary>What *two* steps did we take earlier to guarantee that the Sinatra library is available to load in line 1?</summary>
  <p><blockquote> We specified <code>gem 'sinatra'</code> in the <code>Gemfile</code> *and* successfully ran <code>bundle install</code> to confirm that the gem is installed and "lock" the correct version of it in <code>Gemfile.lock</code>.</blockquote></p>
</details>
<br />

As you see from the above simple example, Sinatra lets you write functions that match an incoming HTTP route, in this 
case `GET '/'` (the root URL), a very simple HTML document containing the string `Hello World` will be returned to the 
presentation tier as the result of the request.

To run our app, we have to start the application server and presentation tier (web) server.  The `rack` application 
server is controlled by a file `config.ru`, which you must now create (again, from outside the running Docker
container) and add to version control, containing the following:

```rb
require './app'
run MyApp
```


The first line tells Rack that our app lives in the file `app.rb`, which you created above to hold your app's code. 
We have to explicitly state that our `app` file is located in the current directory (`.`) because `require` normally 
looks only in standard system directories to find gems.

You're now ready to test-drive our simple app with a command line: `bundle exec rackup --port 3000 -o 0.0.0.0`

This command starts the Rack appserver and the WEBrick webserver. Prefixing it with `bundle exec` ensures that you are 
running with the gems specified in `Gemfile.lock`. Rack will look for `config.ru` and attempt to start our app based 
on the information there.

To see the webapp: Use a web browser on your host machine (outside the Docker container!) and visit `localhost:3000` 
to see the webapp. Verify that you can see "Hello World".

#### Self Check Question

<details>
  <summary>What happens if you try to visit a non-root URL such as <code>https://localhost:3000/hello</code> and why? (your URL root will vary)</summary>
  <p><blockquote> You'll get a humorous error message from the Sinatra framework, since you don't have a route matching <code>get '/hello'</code> in your app.  Since Sinatra is a SaaS framework, the error message is packaged up in a Web page and delivered to your browser.</blockquote></p>
</details>

<br />

You should now have the following files under version control: `Gemfile`, `Gemfile.lock`, `app.rb`, `config.ru`.  
This is a minimal SaaS app: the app file itself, the list of explicitly required gems, the list of actual gems 
installed, including the dependencies implied by the required gems, and a configuration file telling the appserver 
how to start the app.

## Modify the app

Modify `app.rb` so that instead of "Hello World" it prints "Goodbye World". Save your changes to `app.rb` and try 
refreshing your browser tab where the app is running. Remember, to make file edits you will need to do so outside the
Docker container!

No changes? Confused?

Now go back to the Docker shell window where you ran `rackup` and press Ctrl-C to stop Rack.  Then type 
`bundle exec rackup --port 3000 -o 0.0.0.0` for local development, and once it is running, go back to your browser 
tab with your app and refresh the page. This time it should work.

What this shows you is that if you modify your app while it's running, you have to restart `rack` in order for it to 
"see" those changes. Since restarting it manually is tedious, we'll use the `rerun` gem, which restarts `rack` 
automatically when it sees changes to files in the app's directory. (Rails does this for you by default during 
development, as we'll see, but Sinatra doesn't.)

You're probably already thinking: "Aha! If our app depends on this additional gem, we should add it to the Gemfile and 
run `bundle` to make sure it's really present." Good thinking. But it may also occur to you that this particular gem 
wouldn't be necessary in a production environment: we only need it as a tool while developing. Fortunately, there's a 
way to tell `bundler` that some gems are only necessary in certain environments. Add the following to the `Gemfile` 
(it doesn't matter where):

```rb
group :development do
  gem 'rerun'
end
```

Now stop the server again and run `bundle install` to have it download the `rerun` gem and any dependencies, if 
they aren't already in place.

Any gem specifications inside the `group :development` block will only be examined if bundle is run in the development 
environment. (The other environments you can specify are `:test` and `:production`, and you can define new environments
yourself.) Gem specifications outside any group block are assumed to apply in all environments.

Return to the Docker shell window and start your app to verify the app is running: 
`bundle exec rerun -- rackup --port 3000 -o 0.0.0.0`

There are more details on `rerun`'s usage available in the gem's [GitHub README](https://github.com/alexch/rerun#usage). Gems are usually on
GitHub and their READMEs are usually full of helpful instructions about how to use them.

In this case, we are prefixing with `bundle exec` again in order to ensure we are using the gems in the Gemfile.lock, 
and the `--` symbol is there to assert that the command we want `rerun` to operate with is `rackup -p 3000 -o 0.0.0.0`.  
We could achieve the same effect with `bundle exec rerun "rackup -p 3000 -o 0.0.0.0"`. They are equivalent.
More importantly, any detected changes will now cause the server to restart automatically, similar to the use 
of `guard` to auto re-run specs when files change. (**Note: we have had reports of Windows users that don't seem to have
success with the `rerun` command reloading the application. If you experience this, please try using:
`bundle exec rerun --force-polling 'bundle exec rackup -p 3000 -o 0.0.0.0'`, which will periodically restart the server 
every few seconds to check for a filesystem change.)**

Modify `app.rb` to print a different message, and verify that the change is detected by refreshing your browser 
tab with the running app.  Also, before we move on, you should commit your latest changes to git.

## Deploy to Heroku

Heroku is a cloud [platform-as-a-service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) (PaaS) where we can deploy our Sinatra (and later Rails) applications. 
If you don't have an account yet, go sign up at http://www.heroku.com. You'll need your login and password for the 
next step.

Install Heroku CLI on your host computer (not in the Docker container!) following their [instructions](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

Log in to your Heroku account by typing the command: `heroku login -i` in the terminal. This will connect you to your 
Heroku account.  (**Note: if your Heroku account has multifactor authentication enabled, use the Heroku Account settings
to generate an API key. You can then use this key as your password when you log in.**)

While in the root directory of your project (not your whole workspace), type `heroku create` to create a new project in 
Heroku. This will tell the Heroku service to prepare for some incoming code, and locally it will add a remote git 
repository for you called `heroku`.

Next, make sure you stage and commit all changes locally as instructed above (i.e., `git add`, `git commit`, etc.).

Earlier, we saw that to run the app locally you run `rackup` to start the Rack appserver, and Rack looks in `config.ru` 
to determine how to start your Sinatra app. How do you tell a production environment how to start an appserver or 
other processes necessary to receive requests and start your app? In the case of Heroku, this is done with a special 
file named `Procfile`, which specifies one or more types of Heroku processes your app will use, and how to start each 
one. The most basic Heroku process type is called a Dyno, or "web worker". One Dyno can serve one user request at a 
time. Let's create a file named `Procfile`, and only this as the name (i.e. `Procfile.txt` is not valid). Write the 
following line in your `Procfile`:

```
web: bundle exec rackup config.ru -p $PORT
```

This tells Heroku to start a single web worker (Dyno) using essentially the same command line you used to start 
Rack locally. Note that in some cases, a `Procfile` is not necessary since Heroku can infer from your files how to 
start the app. However, it's always better to be explicit.

Once your `Procfile` is created, be sure to add and commit it to your local repo. Your local repo should now be ready
deploy to Heroku:

```
$ git push heroku main
```

(`main` refers to which branch of the remote Heroku repo we are pushing to. We'll learn about branches later 
in the course, but for now, suffice it to say that you can only deploy to the `main` branch on Heroku.) This push will 
create a running instance of your app at some URL ending with `herokuapp.com`. Enter that URL in a new browser tab 
to see your app running live. Congratulations, you did it -- your app is live!

When you are done being impressed with your deployment, be sure to stop and delete the deployed app.  You don't want 
to incur charges to keep running the app!  (The rough cost of a Dyno for a month, without a database attached, is only
$7.)

## Summary

* You started a new application project by creating a `Gemfile` specifying which gems you need and running 
`bundle install` to verify that they're available and create the `Gemfile.lock` file that records the versions of gems 
actually in use.

* You created a Sinatra app in the file `app.rb`, pointed Rack at this file in `config.ru`, and used `rackup` to start 
the appserver and the `webrick` web server.

* You learned that changing the app's code does not automatically cause `rack` to reload the app. To save the work of
restarting the app manually every time you make a change, you used the `rerun` gem, adding it to the `Gemfile` in a way 
that specifies you won't need it in production, only during development.

* You versioned the important files containing not only your app's code but the necessary info to reproduce all the 
libraries it relies on and the file that starts up the app.

* You deployed this simple app to Heroku.
